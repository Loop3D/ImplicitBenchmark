I have provided two implicit fields:

1. lap_vals.txt

Implicit values on tetrahedral points obtained using the finite element laplacian regulerization (eq.36) in the 2022 CAD paper
"Finite Element Implicit 3D Subsurface Structural Modeling"

2. hess_vals.txt

Implicit values on tetrahedral points obtained using the finite element hessian regulerization (a variation of eq.44) in the 2022 CAD paper
"Finite Element Implicit 3D Subsurface Structural Modeling"
