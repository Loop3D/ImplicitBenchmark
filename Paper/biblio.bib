By contrast, machine contouring is a valuable technique in analyzing large masses of data or in routine updating, in analysis of data that do not require a scientific bias for interpretation, in making a suite of maps that is to be mode internally consistent; and in further analysis of resulting surfaces.},

The two most commonly employed numerical surfaces are the weighted-average and finite-difference techniques.

A greedy algorithm in the fitting process reduces the number of RBF centers required to represent a surface and results in significant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a ``smoothest'' interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from nonuniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly filled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the RBF representation has advantages for mesh simplification and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangefinder data.},

Rather, geology is described as a derivative science, relying on the logical techniques exemplified by physics. I argue that this account is inadequate and skews our understanding of both geology and the scientific process in general. Far from simply taking up and applying the logical techniques of physics, geological reasoning has developed its own distinctive set of logical procedures.I begin with a review of contemporary philosophy of science as it relates to geology. I then discuss the two distinctive features of geological reasoning, which are its nature as (1) an interpretive and (2) a historical science. I conclude that geological reasoning offers us the best model of the type of reasoning necessary for confronting the type of problems we are likely to face in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {The process of building three-dimensional (3D) geological models can be framed as an inverse problem where a model describing the 3D distribution of rock units is non-uniquely derived from geological observations. The inverse problem theory provides a powerful framework for inferring these parameters from all geological observations, in a similar way to how a geologist can iteratively update their structural interpretation while mapping. Existing geological knowledge is usually indirectly incorporated into 3D models using the geologist's non-unique interpretation as form lines, cross sections and level maps. These approaches treat constraints derived from geological knowledge in the same way as direct observations, diluting and confusing both information provided by geological knowledge and hard data resulting in significant subjectivity. We present a geological inversion using Bayesian inference where geological knowledge can be incorporated directly into the interpolation scheme with likelihood functions and informative prior distributions. We demonstrate these approaches on a series of synthetic fold shapes as a proof of concept and a case study from the Proterozoic Davenport Province in the Northern Territory, Australia. The combined inversion of geological data and knowledge significantly reduces the uncertainty in possible fold geometries where data is sparse or highly ambiguous. This could be used by geologists while mapping to propagate information about uncertainties throughout the mapping/model building process and would allow for different structural interpretations to be rapidly tested for targeted data collection.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in structural modeling techniques have dramatically increased the capability to incorporate fold-related data into the modeling workflow. However, these techniques are lacking a mathematical framework for properly addressing structural uncertainties. Previous studies investigating structural uncertainties have focused on the sensitivity of the interpolator to perturbing the input data. These approaches do not incorporate conceptual uncertainty about the geological structures and interpolation process to the overall uncertainty estimate. In this work, we frame structural modeling as an inverse problem and use a Bayesian framework to reconcile structural parameters and data uncertainties. Bayesian inference is applied for determining the posterior probability distribution of fold parameters given a set of structural observations and prior distributions based on general geological knowledge and regional observations. This approach allows for an inversion of structural geology data, where each realization can differ in the structural description of the fold geometries, instead of finding only a single best fit solution. We show that analyzing the variability between the resulting models highlights uncertainties associated with the geometry of regional structures. These areas can be used to target where additional data would be most beneficial for improving the model quality and efficiently reducing structural uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) geometry of complexly deformed regions is often beyond the scope of simple 2D and 2.5D representation in cross-sections and block diagrams. Methods must be developed for fully three-dimensional representation. A workflow for such three-dimensional modelling of structurally complex areas is presented. Data requirements are tailored to typical results of structural field work in strongly deformed rocks from mid-crustal levels. The workflow is based on data evaluation and data export using standard geographical information system and database management systems. Three-dimensional modelling in polyphase deformed areas is highly dependent on the correct interpretation of variations in the orientation of the dominant planar fabrics. The computer-aided earth-modelling software 3D GeoModeller is well adapted for managing this problem. It calculates the geometry of geological interfaces taking into account simultaneously the foliation data and location of lithological contacts. The workflow is based on iterative model refinement based on interactive editing of the geometry in section and map views with data assessment and pre-processing using GIS software. This approach assures internal consistency of the resulting three-dimensional models. Modelling of the Lower Lepontine Nappes in the Central Alps is used as an illustrative example from a complexly deformed terrain.},

A wide range of methods exists to generate geological models. 5 However, especially the powerful methods are behind a paywall in expensive commercial packages. We present here a full open-source geomodeling method, based on an implicit potential-field interpolation approach. The interpolation algorithm is comparable to implementations in commercial packages and capable of constructing complex full 3-D geological models, including fault networks, fault-surface interactions, unconformities, and dome structures. This algorithm is implemented in 10 the programming language Python, making use of a highly efficient underlying library for efficient code generation (theano) that enables a direct execution on GPU's. The functionality can be separated into the core aspects required to generate 3-D geological models and additional assets for advanced scientific investigations. These assets provide the full power behind our approach, as they enable the link to Machine Learning and Bayesian inference frameworks and thus a path to stochas15 tic geological modeling and inversions. In addition, we provide methods to analyse model topology and to compute gravity fields on the basis of the geological models and assigned density values. In summary, we provide a basis for open scientific research using geological models, with the aim to foster reproducible research in the field of geomodeling.},

The interpolation framework is paired with a method to automatically infer the locally predominant orientations, which results in a rapid and robust iterative non-stationary boundary modeling technique that can refine locally anisotropic geological shapes automatically from the sample data. The method also permits quantification of the volumetric uncertainty associated with the boundary modeling.

Despite its many desirable properties, Sibson's method is computationally expensive and difficult to implement, especially when applied to higher-dimensional data. The main reason for both problems is the method's implementation based on a Voronoi diagram of all data points. We describe a discrete approach to evaluating Sibson's interpolant on a regular grid, based solely on finding nearest neighbors and rendering and blending d-dimensional spheres. Our approach does not require us to construct an explicit Voronoi diagram, is easily implemented using commodity three-dimensional graphics hardware, leads to a significant speed increase compared to traditional approaches, and generalizes easily to higher dimensions. For large scattered data sets, we achieve two-dimensional (2D) interpolation at interactive rates and 3D interpolation (3D) with computation times of a few seconds.},

  abstract = {In geology, implicit structural modelling constructs the geometry of geological structures (e.g. layers) by interpolating between sparse field data. A model is represented by a volumetric scalar field which is discontinuous on structural discontinuities such as faults or stratigraphic unconformities. The management of such discontinuities may involve boolean operations on several scalar fields or the creation of conformal meshes. Instead, we propose a ghost cell technique for the cartesian grid together with a set of relations between the ghost points, the regular nodes, and the discontinuities. Consequently, poor quality meshes are avoided and only the resolution of the grid has an impact on the solution. The modelling problem is posed as a least square's minimization of a bending energy penalization on data mismatch functions and approximated by finite difference. As all relationships in the grid are implicitly defined, except close to the discontinuities, this algorithm is computationally efficient. We provide some benchmarks of the method on two-dimensional examples with folds, faults, and erosions.},

  abstract = {Abstract
Three-dimensional structural modeling is gaining importance for a broad range of quantitative geoscientific applications. However, existing approaches are still limited by the type of structural data they are able to use and by their lack of structural meaning. Most techniques heavily rely on spatial data for modeling folded layers, but are unable to completely use cleavage and lineation information for constraining the shape of modeled folds. This lack of structural control is generally compensated by expert knowledge introduced in the form of additional interpretive data such as cross-sections and maps. With this approach, folds are explicitly designed by the user instead of being derived from data. This makes the resulting structures subjective and deterministic.

This paper introduces a numerical framework for modeling folds and associated foliations from typical field data. In this framework, a parametric description of fold geometry is incorporated into the interpolation algorithm. This way the folded geometry is implicitly derived from observed data, while being controlled through structural parameters such as fold wavelength, amplitude and tightness. A fold coordinate system is used to support the numerical description of fold geometry and to modify the behavior of classical structural interpolators. This fold frame is constructed from fold-related structural elements such as axial foliations, intersection lineations, and vergence. Poly-deformed terranes are progressively modeled by successively modeling each folding event going backward through time.

The proposed framework introduces a new modeling paradigm, which enables the building of three-dimensional geological models of complex poly-deformed terranes. It follows a process based on the structural geologist approach and is able to produce geomodels that honor both structural data and geological knowledge.},

  title = {Visualization of Complex Geological Structures Using 3-{{D B\'ezier}} Construction Tools},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {Various 3-D visualization methods use structural \textregistered{}eld data to constrain geological models. One approach is to employ 3-D b-Splines, a class of Be\^A zier curves, to densify point data sets too sparse and clustered for direct spatial interpolation. Be\^A zier curves are implemented to act as construction lines that respect the constraints imposed by structural orientation data. These 3-D construction lines are de\textregistered{}ned by tangents to local planar features, and the projection of key geologic structures. A method is presented that estimates the local strike and dip of vertices along elevation registered 3-D curvilinear geological features. The local direction cosine estimates derived along the surface traces of geological structures are interpolated, and linearly projected to depth. In regions where subparallel relationships exist between local and regional scale structures it is possible to constrain modeled regional geometry to the \textregistered{}eld data. The success of any 3-D geological modeling exercise is dependent on the data density, clustering and depth variability of known structural observations, and the geological relationship of local structures to regional bounding surfaces. Ultimately, methodologies to generate geological models from regions of sparse data will need to be able to combine computer aided geometric design (CAGD) tools with constraining software, which respects structural \textregistered{}eld observations. Several examples are given to emphasize this point. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Several well established explicit and implicit techniques can be used to identify the limits of an ore zone; however, most techniques are unable to account for uncertainty in a straightforward manner, where uncertainty originates from the sparseness of sample data relative to the volume of the resource in question. An implicit technique that benefits from simplicity and has the capabilities to incorporate and account for uncertainty in boundary geometry is signed distance function (SDF) modeling. Sample data that is in the form of line segments from drill holes presents challenges for interpolators such as kriging and radial basis functions. Utilizing linear regression as an interpolator several advantages to the problem are realized. The particular variant of regression that is used is moving least squares (MLS) that permits the exact integration of line data from drill holes and human interpretations without the need for discretization or numerical integration approaches. Integrating line data is critical for including explicit interpretations into implicit boundary models because geologic interpretations commonly involve polygons digitized on two dimensional sections through a field of drill holes.},

  abstract = { 3D modeling of highly deformed regions is challenging regarding structural consistency, especially when only sparse data are available. Implicit techniques oﬀer easy and fast ways of integrating and editing orientation data, but often lead to over-simpliﬁed results in regions where several phases of folding deformation occurred. To address this problem, we propose new tools to interpolate ﬁeld measurements of folded formations and associated features.
A series of Discrete Smooth Interpolation (DSI) constraints has already shown its eﬃciency for the data interpolation in the implicit domain. In particular, the fold axis DSI constraint considers a global fold axis direction on the whole folded domain, yielding sub-cylindrical folds while strictly honouring available data. This constraint has been improved with the possibility of using a 3D vectorial ﬁeld instead of a uniform axial direction. Additional information is contained in cleavages and lineations associated with folds. Indeed, when they are parallel to the axial surface, they help with the determination of large scale variations of the axial trace attitude, diﬃcult to determine from localized ﬁeld measurements. Also, when fan cleavages are orthogonal to stratigraphic horizons, their orientation can guide the interpolation away from the axial surface.
All those features are integrated in a scalar ﬁeld whose gradient is the axial direction, before being used as a new input for interpolating the stratigraphy. This constraint had been tested on the migmatitic dome of Naxos, Greece, where the geometry of subdomes was successfully deﬁned. Finally, a new DSI constraint integrates a similar folding style to get anisopach folds. }

This scheme is believed to oﬀer some geometrical ﬂexibility as it is readily implemented on both structured and unstructured grids. While implicit modeling on unstructured grids is not new, methods based on ﬁnite elements have received little attention. The ﬁnite element method is routinely used to solve boundary value problems. However, because boundary conditions are typically unknown in implicit subsurface structural modeling, the traditional ﬁnite element method requires some adjustments. To this end, we present boundary free discretizations of the Laplacian and Hessian energies that do not assume vanishing Neumann boundary conditions, thereby eliminating the boundary artifacts usually associated with that assumption. Furthermore, we argue that while an appropriate discretization of the Laplacian can be used to minimize the curvature of a function on triangulated meshes, it may fail to do so on tetrahedral meshes.},

Most advanced methods for generating these models are implicit approaches, but they suffer limitations in the types of interpolation constraints permitted, which can lead to poor modeling in structurally complex settings. A geometric deep learning approach, using graph neural networks, is presented in this paper as an alternative to classical implicit interpolation that is driven by a learning through training paradigm. The graph neural network approach consists of a developed architecture utilizing unstructured meshes as graphs on which coupled implicit and discrete geological unit modeling is performed, with the latter treated as a classification problem. The architecture generates three-dimensional structural models constrained by scattered point data, sampling geological units and interfaces as well as planar and linear orientations. The modeling capacity of the architecture for representing geological structures is demonstrated from its application on two diverse case studies. The benefits of the approach are (1) its ability to provide an expressive framework for incorporating interpolation constraints using loss functions and (2) its capacity to deal with both continuous and discrete properties simultaneously. Furthermore, a framework is established for future research for which additional geological constraints can be integrated into the modeling process.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Implicit structural modeling using sparse and unevenly distributed data is essential for various scientific and societal purposes, ranging from natural source exploration to geological hazard forecasts. Most advanced implicit approaches formulate structural modeling as least squares minimization or spatial interpolation, using various mathematical methods to solve for a scalar field that optimally fits all the inputs under an assumption of smooth regularization. However, these approaches may not reasonably represent complex geometries and relationships of structures and may fail to fit a global structural trend when the known data are too sparse or unevenly distributed. Additionally, solving a large system of mathematical equations with iterative optimization solvers could be computationally expensive in 3-D. To deal with these issues, we propose an efficient deep learning method using a convolution neural network to create a full structural model from the sparse interpretations of stratigraphic interfaces and faults. The network is beneficial for the flexible incorporation of geological empirical knowledge when trained by numerous synthetic models with realistic structures that are automatically generated from a data simulation workflow. It also presents an impressive characteristic of integrating various types of geological constraints by optimally minimizing a hybrid loss function in training, thus opening new opportunities for further improving the structural modeling performance. Moreover, the deep neural network, after training, is highly efficient for the generation of structural models in many geological applications. The capacity of our approach for modeling complexly deformed structures is demonstrated by using both synthetic and field datasets in which the produced models can be geologically reasonable and structurally consistent with the inputs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for tetrahedral mesh generation for subsurface reservoir structural modeling based on sequentially cutting an input tetrahedral grid with geological surfaces represented by implicit functions. Most of the existing literature on meshing to implicit surfaces mainly focuses on independent closed surfaces, making it hardly applicable to subsurface structural modeling where, in addition to occasional closed surfaces (e.g., detached salt diapirs), the subsurface model is typically made of a mixture of multiple intersecting ﬁnite surfaces (e.g., faults) and inﬁnite surfaces (e.g., horizons). This peculiar setting sometimes makes it challenging to build a sealed structural surface model (i.e., a boundary representation model), which is the starting point of traditional, but also challenging, constrained Delaunay solid mesh generation. The method presented herein bypasses the creation of a sealed surface model and generates a solid mesh directly from point sets and/or a set of topologically disconnected surfaces; the sealed surface model is obtained as a byproduct, if needed.},
