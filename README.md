# ImplicitBenchmark
Data for the implicit structural modeling benchmark paper

This repository is designed to test various implicit structural modeling codes
on common data sets.
 
Each benchmark data set should be stored in a separate sub-directory 
having the following structure: 
 * `_ReadMe.md` file explaining the data set
 * Data points in .csv format. 
 * [Optionally] a `Result_` directory to be used as template for various teams

Please have a look at `_ReadMe.md` files in each subdirectory for examples.
